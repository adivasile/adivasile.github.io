    Hi, I'm Adrian. I'm a software engineer based in Bucharest, Romania and I specialize in building Ruby on Rails applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a strong focus on writing clean and understandable code, refactoring and removing complexity. Code that's easy to understand is easy do debug and to optimize. I'm always searching for ways to challenge my beliefs and keep an open mind about new ways to work and learn.
  </p>
  <p>I'm a big fan of a terminal based workflow, <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">neovim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a> are at the core of my development environment. You can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/adivasile/dotfiles" target="_blank">my dotfiles</a> to see how I have my tools set up.
